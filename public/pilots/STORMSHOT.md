The station, Astraeus, was along a major trade route, resources were plentiful, as were visitors. Astraeus was parked outside a warp gate, it served as the first, or last stop before and after ships moved through the warp gate. As such, the station's focus was on refueling and resupply. The commercial area was generally stocked with goods to provide creature comforts to the people making long voyages through space. Latha Sarpy met a myriad of individuals but she always took a shine to the military oriented Lancers that came through.

The station was entirely man-made and was held in synchronous orbit with the nearby warp gate. Although an important station, Astraeus was beginning to show signs of aging. The signs were not due to neglect, but born out of time and use. At the onset of Latha's departure, the station had just secured the funding to retrofit and upgrade itself.

Latha grew up in the station, her parents both merchants in the commercial district peddling commodities to the space travelers. Due to their occupation, Latha spent much time in their shop helping, and serving customers from all over the galaxy. Due to the interaction with so many people Latha began learning languages from a young age and immersed herself in whatever new culture she could prise from the station's many visitors.

Latha grew up with a loving family who were able to provide for her the trappings of a comfortable, albeit boring life. Latha yearned for more. More excitement. More languages. More cultures. More!

When Latha came of true working age, she signed on to help the Engineering Corps on the station, not due to any sort of interest in orbital mechanics, repairs, or ideas for tinkering with electronics or mechanics. No, it was to get closer and train to become the member of the Engineering Corps that dealt with and used explosives.

It was during her time in the Engineering Corps that she met Elio "Khepri" Pama, a member of a Lancer squad attached to a protection detail of a cargo hauler. The hauler was severely damaged due to an attack and would need to be docked for several weeks for repairs. They happened to meet one day outside the Engineering Corps bulkhead as he was looking for an Engineer to make some upgrades to his mech. Latha and Elio spent much time together over those few weeks, seeing each other daily if their duties allowed.

Once the cargo hauler was repaired, Elio and his Lancer squad, which was led by a man called Zenn, had to resume their escort. Elio swore he would come back once his contract was executed.

That was many years ago. There has been no word of Elio since that day. Latha has taken it upon herself to train to become a Lancer so she can chase after Elio to find out the truth of what happened to him, and why he never came back.

She trained hard. Every day until her skills were recognized as being elite enough to pilot a Lancer. A feat the station-born still talk about to this day.

One day, whilst Latha was preparing to leave the station in search of Elio, a message came to her personal data pad. It was from the man named Zenn, and it read:

//NEW MESSAGE FROM CONTACT: Zenn//

//SUBJECT: Calling in all my favors//

I’m sending this message to anyone I think I can still trust.  I can’t do this on my own, I need your help.

Before you agree you need to be aware that I’m asking you to give up everything you know. By now I am far, far away. A generation will have passed where you are before you can hope to make your way back home.  The stakes are that high.

If you can still help me then find The Last Good Drink on Wenshan Station.  You will meet some old acquaintances of mine who will join you on this long journey.  You should know that they may not know of the journey that they are about to take, but they are good people who you can trust to do right.

Once you make it here, follow my name.  Find me.

//END//

Maybe she would learn nothing about Elio while she answered this summons, but she knew that this was at least a good place to start. Find and help the man who knew Elio and maybe he could help her find him. At last she had a direction and a small modicum of hope. She departed the next day, her new mech in tow.
