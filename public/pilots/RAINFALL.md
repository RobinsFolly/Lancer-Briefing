# Mission // #001
## Planetfall

Operation Downpour has begun and, like clockwork, the Lancers are needed as a breakthrough force to pierce the outer ring of defenses.

# Goals
- Assault the fortified enemy command center (complete)
- Recon the sublevels of the complex

# Stakes
- A research substation is present in the undergroun complex, and its extraneous defense begs the question as to what they want to keep hidden below
# Reserves
- No reserve troops are available for this deployment at this time.
