# Mission // #001
## Pitstop
# Goals
Learn how these weapon platforms came to be in orbit around Kiemene by recovering the anomalous station's data core

# Stakes
The Revenant Dawn succeeded in disabling the station's defenses but has been diverted from continuing actions against the Space Defense network in order to rescue SWO Alyanna Saavedra. This will delay the operation to eliminate hostile SD assets.  It is possible these stations can be turned planet-side.

If the Diamond Dogs neutralize the station but fail to recover the data core they will be unable to learn anything about the nature of these stations.
# Reserves
- None at this time.
