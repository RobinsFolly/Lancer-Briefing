# Mission // #001
## Pitstop
# Goals
Learn how these weapon platforms came to be in orbit around Kiemene by recovering the anomalous station's data core

# Stakes
If the Battlegroup fails to disable the station defenses the Revenant Dawn could have to retreat until repairs can be completed and more carefully eliminate the stations, which will take time.  Its also possible these stations can be turned planet-side.

If the Diamond Dogs neutralize the station but fail to recover the data core they will be unable to learn anything about the nature of these stations.
# Reserves
- None at this time.
