# Mission // #003
## Reconnect

Union Forces are not broadcasting a transponder signal and are not responding to hails.  Find out what happened to the UNEF forces and if possible locate survivors.

# Goals
- Make contact with surviving UNEF Forces (complete)
- Find out what happened to the UNEF Forces station at FOB Huntly
- Meet with the commanding officer of the surviving UNEF Forces

# Stakes
- The surviving UNEF forces likely have intel on the events that took place at FOB Huntly and perhaps valuable insight on the tactical situation in the area.  The information the Union Exiles have could prove very important in regaining control of the region.

# Reserves
- TBD
