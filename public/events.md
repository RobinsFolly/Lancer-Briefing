# Planet Kiemene - Gateway Region - Calus Preserve // Late 5022U
After finishing a few much-needed upgrades our PCs depart Casandra’s Crossing for the Calus Preserve.  While trekking through the dense jungle they received a call from the Revenant Dawn bearing good news.  The SD network has been neutralized and the Dawn is preparing to offer support for its two Lancer teams.  The Dawn’s Drone network set to work providing satellite imagery and GPS information.  Additional information from Porter was relayed to the Lancers.  The space station had been identified as “Lucosa L2 station.” A derelict space station in the outer solar system that was little more than a navigation hazard for half a millennium.

The Revenant Dawn and her crew now stand by to offer additional assistance.

Half a day later the Lancers finally make their way to the Union Exile’s camp, reestablishing contact with the only known Union survivors on the planet.  Approaching malnutrition and short on supplies, it became obvious that the exiles would need some help before they could offer help of their own.  Lieutenant Zuric, acting commander of the exiles, suggested the Lancers assist them on a boar hunt.  Their prey: SabreTusks, massive genetically engineered boars bioengineered to provide massive amounts of meat…and offer a considerable challenge to a mechanized chassis.

Over a meager dinner the Lancers continued plying the exiles for information and learned a great deal.

There exists an ancient House Metarius military base, abandoned even before the SecCom “liberation” of Kiemene.  The base was abandoned quickly and still hides a plethora of supplies.  Visiting the base won’t come without risk; however, it is frequented not only by AutoScavs, but by a dangerous form of hostile fauna native to Kiemene.

The Lancers learned that the AutoScavs are actually heavily modified mining drones that began wreaking havoc only eleven years ago; years after House Metarius wrested control of the Gateway region and corresponding with reports of a ship crashing in the Te’tasiilaq region.  The Autoscav factory is located on the Western edge of the Gateway region, nestled against the northern mountain peaks.  The drones indiscriminately attack anything that approaches the facility.

As the hour grew late the Lancers were given one final piece of advice: Talk to Caylor Fielding about FOB Huntly and the Gateway region.

After several days of near constant action and travel, the fatigue finally caught up to our Lancers, who drifted off to sleep in the strangely cozy cave…
