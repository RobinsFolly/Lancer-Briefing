# UNS-SL Revenant Dawn // Late 5018U
Our team of Lancers spent the last several months travelling to the mysterious Bright star system.  Their days were spent training in the simulator, studying replays and strategy, while working on their own projects in the evenings.  They got truly acquainted with ship life via a series of rotating duties, helping out where they could aboard the ship.

The Revenant Dawn crossed into Bright's heliosphere and began deceleration.  Continuing to fall towards Kiemene, tensions grew as the crew was unable to make contact with Union forces on the ground.  Scout probes reached Kiemene and returned imagery of the capital city, Metariapolis, obviously at war, despite what initially appeared to be business as usual at FOB Huntly, Union headquarters on Kiemene, some hundreds of kilometers West of the capital.  **Jace** recognized some inconsistancies in the telemetry from FOB Huntly and it became apparent that something is obscuring the scans.
Before anyone could look into things any further, Dawn registered incoming ordinance and began evasive maneuvers.  The Rangers were launched immediately to regain control of the capital, while the Diamond Dogs remained on board.
The Revenant Dawn races towards the source of the incoming fire, an anomolous space station in orbit around Kiemene that shouldn't be there.
The ship's multiple NHPs came together in Legion to form a Gestalt being known as Revenant and invited Delilah and Madison to join them in taking the fight to the enemy on multiple planes of existance.
