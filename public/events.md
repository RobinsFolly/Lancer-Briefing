# UNS-SL Revenant Dawn // Late 5018U
**Kiemene Orbit**
Under attack from the unexpected Space Defense network in orbit around Kiemene, the Revenant Dawn deploys its assets to neutralize the threat.  Taking advantage of a temporary blind spot the Dawn successfully disables one of the stations and deploys the Diamond Dogs in a boarding action to gather information from the mysterious station.  During the fight to disable the station the Spectre stealth fighter, piloted by SWO Alyanna Saavedra, is holed through by a tungsten rod fired from the station's rail gun.  The Revenant Dawn temporarily suspends its attack on the remaining stations to rescue the stranded pilot before she is lost to space forever.  Meanwhile, Davion's Rangers speed toward the surface of Kiemene to begin their mission to gather intelligence on the fighting in the capital, Metariapolis.
The Diamond Dogs begin their raid on the station, fighting through waves of automated drones they succeed in breaching the station and find themselves inside an empty hangar bay.
