# Planet Kiemene - Gateway Region - Calus Preserve // Late 5022U
The morning after the Half-Pint Heroes and UNEF exiles celebrate a very successful hunt, most of the group prepares to move out and journey to Casandra’s Crossing to barter their spoils.  Moral is high as the exiles feel purpose and duty for the first time in a very long time.  Not wanting to spoil the mood, and visibly relieved at her gaps in memory, nobody tells Press about her violent actions the night before.  Stormshot, bruised about the face and ego, avoids contact with most and defaults to maintaining a professional bearing.
Raven puzzles over the decrypted data from the Observation Post, trying to piece together a cohesive narrative while Madison conducts Wraith’s prechecks.

As smooth as a well-oiled machine the UNEF exiles break camp and together with the Half-Pints move out, marching for Casandra’s Crossing.

Hours into the march, Raven and Stormshot nearly stumble into an active hunt.  A pack of bestial quadrupedal apex predators have surrounded and wounded a mysterious and beautiful creature which they soon discover has inexplicable abilities.

Not waiting for confirmation on the ROE for interfering with local wildlife, Raven storms into the clearing, intent to rescue the beleaguered creature.  It doesn’t take him long to feel the consequences of this bumrush as the lightning quick predators turn their attention to him, forcing Stormshot to rush into the fray as well.

Soon joined by Press the Half-Pints make short work of the predators and Jace approaches the creature, which Madison identifies as a Stilline, a fabled creature assumed native to a far-off world designated as a national park by Union, its only human inhabitants living a reclusive lifestyle in a few arcologies at the edge of a continent spanning jungle.  The massive lion like creature lies down to allow Jace to patch it up.  With a forceful nuzzle from a creature with the head the size of his chest, the Stilline knocks Jace from his feet before disappearing into thin air.

Perhaps awed, perhaps in wonder or simply confused, the party continues on toward Casandra’s Crossing.
