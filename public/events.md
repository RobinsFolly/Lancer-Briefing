# UNS-SL Revenant Dawn // Late 5018U
Our team of Lancers spent the last several months travelling to the mysterious Bright star system.  Their days were spent training in the simulator, studying replays and strategy, while working on their own projects in the evenings.  They got truly acquainted with ship life via a series of rotating duties, helping out where they could aboard the ship.

During this time **Latha** focused on self-improvement and relationships by making a legitimate effort to get to know the crew, studying leadership tactics, and training to pilot the Caliban as her primary chassis.
**Jace** trained to be more discerning and spot details through a series of adaptive simulator programs.  During his off time he worked to understand the strange flashback he had after being struck in the head, eventually leading to remembering some details that had implications about everything he thought he knew of himself.
**Ridge** got to know LT Lopez quite well.  While his romantic interests were not reciprocated, LT Lopez is very approving of Ridge and would certainly go out of her way to help in the future.   Ridge also spent a considerable amount of time snooping, discovering that this was not a Navy vessel, but a DOJ/HR one, that had been conducting missions like this one for a very long time.  His snooping was noticed…but nobody on the crew seemed to care, if anything they were approving.
**X’s** attempts to woo Lt Lopez were met much worse off than Ridge’s.  Such that when he needed assistance with his Mech’s engineering suite, he had to barter with other crew members in order to scrounge up something he could use.  He’ll have to put some additional work into it before its operational.  Additionally, X spent time hacking ship’s terminals for fun.  This was noticed by Dawn, who reacted just the same as when Ridge “adjusted” some settings during his “game” with Dawn prior to departure from Wenshan station.  It would seem she isn’t overly concerned with the party’s ability to manipulate her systems.  Either way, X is a better code jockey than he was a few months ago.
