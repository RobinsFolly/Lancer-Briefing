# Planet Kiemene - Gateway Region - Calus Preserve // Late 5022U
After departing the horror show that was the scene of their battle to save the wounded Stilline from a pack of Axetail, the Half-Pints and Exiles come across a patiently waiting Shikari hunting party who warn them that a Metarius patrol has stopped at Casandra’s Crossing and has been asking questions.
Jace slipped ahead of the Half-Pints, following the hunting party back to Casandra’s crossing.  Finally satisfied that they weren’t leading his friends into any sort of ambush, he stole some oversized overalls and took off to meet his friends.  Indeed, he was quite a sight, partially invisible, carrying a pile of overalls through a huge open field.  
Freshly adorned, the Half-Pints entered town with a container of Sabertusk meat.  After a short an awkward detour to the Techsmith the trio arrived at the Inn, where they were promptly greeted by a chagrined Severan who ushered them quickly to the kitchen, out of sight of the now mostly drunk Metarius pilots.
Severen, hopeful that these Union special operators know what they’re doing, agrees to play along with their ploy.  A few moments later and they are buying a round of drinks at the bar with the credit earned from their traded container of boar meat.  “Meat Merchant” identities firmly established; Press attracts the attention of the Metarius pilots by balancing her pickaxe on her chin.  In short order one of their number is drooling at her feet and making painfully awkward attempts to impress her.
After engrossing in each other’s war stories Jace hooked the pilots with hundreds of pounds of meat.  He offered to meet the pilots in the jungle with a crate of meat and trade it for more whitewash nanites.  Though his initial intentions weren’t clear to his compatriots, Jace eventually settled on making an honest deal with the Syndicate troops and met them on foot at a location recommended by Frizz.
Unfortunately, the Syndicate pilots had no intention of honoring any deal.  On arrival they quickly seized the meat and attacked Jace, who promptly fell back and was met by Madison in his Duskwing.  Tremendously surprised by the arrival of a state-of-the-art SSC Mech, the Metarius pilots committed to a fight.  As it happens, there are a very different set of procedures for dealing with Lancers than for dealing with meat merchants.
After a fiery and intense in-your-face firefight, four of the five Metarius pilots lay dead in the crumpled remains of their mechs, while the fifth retreats through the jungle…
