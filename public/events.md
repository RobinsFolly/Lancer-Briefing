# Planet Kiemene - Casandra's Crossing // Late 5022U
The Diamond Dogs, having trekked through a few hundred miles of open desert in the middle of a massive sandstorm, approach their next objective: An observation post overlooking the isthmus that forms the gateway between the Te’Raggis desert and the more fertile lands to the south.  Its here that the PCs come across a beleaguered squad of Union marines under attack by an unknown automated force of nanite wielding scavengers.  After a tense firefight the Diamond Dogs eliminate the AutoScavs, but not before they can call in an orbital strike that partially destroys the observation post and injures two marines, killing a third.  After a brief discussion with the Marine squad leader, “Kush” Ramsey, the PCs quickly scour the remains of the observation post, nabbing a hard drive before escaping to the East, making their way toward the only settlement in the area, Casandra’s Crossing.
On reaching Casandra’s Crossing the Diamond Dogs are introduced to Severan Tu’Galta, mayor of Casandra’s Crossing.   After having identified themselves as Union, Severan ushers the Diamond Dogs into Casandra’s Crossing, hiding their mechs in a warehouse he calls the TechSmith.  He implores the Diamond Dogs to minimize their time in town, lest the Metarius Syndicate discover their presence and wreak havoc on the town for harboring fugitives.
The PCs check in at the clinic, meeting again with Kush Ramsey, who relays the location of the Union Exile’s camp, before leaving town with the remaining able-bodied marines, leaving the rest in the professional care of Doctor Suren Bukula.
Lysa notices a sick young girl in the clinic and discovers that she has been infected with a particularly virulent native parasite known as ‘The Sledge’.  She learns that without a sample of a native spore that is a natural enemy to The Sledge, the young girl, Paige, will surely die.  Doc Bukula recommends conversing with Chief Fielding, a Union Exile, about the girl’s condition.  Further, he lets slip his shortage of Whitewash nanites, again stating that Chief Fielding is the best person to talk to about where these nanites can be found.
After this, the PCs make their way to the Techsmith to conduct repairs and upgrades before continuing their journey…
