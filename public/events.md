# Planet Kiemene - Gateway Region - Calus Preserve // Late 5022U
After departing the horror show that was the scene of their battle to save the wounded Stilline from a pack of Axetail, the Half-Pints and Exiles come across a patiently waiting Shikari hunting party who warn them that a Metarius patrol has stopped at Casandra’s Crossing and has been asking questions.

Jace slipps ahead of the Half-Pints, following the hunting party back to Casandra’s crossing.  Eventually satisfied that they weren’t leading his friends into any sort of ambush, he steals some oversized overalls and takes off to meet his friends.  Indeed, he was quite a sight, partially invisible, carrying a pile of perfectly visible overalls through a huge open field.  
Freshly adorned, the Half-Pints enter town with a container of Sabertusk meat.  After a short an awkward detour to the Techsmith the trio arrive at the Inn, where they are promptly greeted by a chagrined Severan who ushers them quickly to the kitchen, out of sight of the now mostly drunk Metarius pilots.
Severen, hopeful that these Union special operators know what they’re doing, agrees to play along with their ploy.  A few moments later and they are buying a round of drinks at the bar with the credit earned from their traded container of boar meat.  “Meat Merchant” identities firmly established; Press attracts the attention of the Metarius pilots by balancing her pickaxe on her chin.  In short order one of their number is drooling at her feet and making painfully awkward attempts to impress her.
After engrossing in each other’s war stories of finding scary animals in the jungle, Jace hooks the pilots with hundreds of pounds of meat.  He offers to rendezvous with the pilots in the jungle with a crate of meat and trade it for more whitewash nanites.  Though his initial intentions weren’t clear to his compatriots, Jace eventually settls on making an honest deal with the Syndicate troops and meets them on foot at a location recommended by Frizz.
Unfortunately, the Syndicate pilots have no intention of honoring any deal.  On arrival they quickly seize the meat and attack Jace, who promptly falls back and is met by Madison and Wraith.  Tremendously surprised by the arrival of a state-of-the-art SSC Mech, the Metarius pilots committed to a fight.  As it happens, there are a very different set of procedures for dealing with Lancers than for dealing with meat merchants.
Press uses stealth to eliminate part of the squad with great efficiency, while Stormshot blasts and punches the enemy into a nice group with her at the center.  Still just as efficient, but far louder and messier.

After an intense battle, four of the five Metarius pilots lay dead in the crumpled remains of their mechs, while the fifth retreats through the jungle…
